# check-point-client

This file is an adaptation of a script downloaded from the internet, this already has a binary zip inside the script, so if you want to edit use the "vi".

(Recomendation) For the first run it is necessary to enter password and token manually, as there is a problem that I will be dealing with in the future for certificate acceptance.

Now to run manually the first time do this:
```bash
$ snx -s <host> -u <user> -g
```
After this first access in this way, you can use the service that was created on your local machine as follows:
```bash
$ svpn start | stop | restart
```
and that's it ... feel free to edit and improve the toy
